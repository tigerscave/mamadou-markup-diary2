    <h1>Typography</h1>
    <p>While typography has been practiced for many centuries, digital font design is a <br>
        relatively new discipline. There are some great examples of old-school fonts (also called typefaces) which have been adopted for  use on digital displays.<br>
        However, i would like to highlight a few of my favorite fonts that were created <br>
        with screens in mind.</p>

    <h2>Serif</h2>
    <p>Serifs are the small features at the end of sttrokes within letters. These features are Functional as well as decorative.<br>
         Serif fonts are widely used for body text (eg. artcles) because they are cosidered they are considered <br>
         easier to read than sans-serif fonts in print.</p>
    <p>serif fonts can often create a feeling of traditionalism and antiquity,<br>
         due to their common use in printed materials for many years.</p>
