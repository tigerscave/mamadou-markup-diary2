    <h1>Typography</h1>
    <p>While typography has been practiced for many centuries, digital font design is a <br>
        relatively new discipline. There are some great examples of old-school fonts (also called typefaces) which have been adopted for  use on digital displays.<br>
        However, i would like to highlight a few of my favorite fonts that were created <br>
        with screens in mind.</p>
